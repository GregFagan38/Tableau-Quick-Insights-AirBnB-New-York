## Project Overview  
This Tableau storyboard focuses on identifying **ideal locations and property types in New York** for purchasing and renting out on Airbnb. Additionally, it provides insights into determining the **proper rental price** for the chosen property. By adhering to storytelling and visualization best practices, we aim to guide users effectively through our analysis.

## Focus and Storyline  
Our analysis revolves around answering two key questions:  
1. **Which locations and types of properties in New York are ideal for purchasing to rent out on Airbnb?**  
2. **What is the proper rental price for your chosen property?**  

To ensure a cohesive narrative, all visuals are interconnected and aligned with this storyline. We avoided disjointed graphs or standalone dashboards to deliver a unified user experience.

## Visualization Guidelines and Design Choices  

### Guiding Audience Focus  
- **Bold Font as a Pre-Attentive Attribute:** Keywords are highlighted in bold to draw attention to essential details, as taught in class.  
- **Filtered Hotel Data:** Hotel data was excluded to focus solely on Airbnb rentals, reducing clutter and emphasizing relevant information.  

### Use of Color  
- **Sequential Color Palette:** Applied on maps to represent the number of listings by borough. Lighter colors denote lower values, while darker colors indicate higher values, following recommended practices.  
- **Consistency Across Visuals:** The same color palette is used for similar visual elements, such as borough-based maps.  

### Minimizing Visual Noise  
- **Direct Labels Over Legends:** Graphs are labeled directly to enhance clarity, such as on the "Forecasted Average Prices for Room Types" board.  
- **Active Titles and Explainers:** Each board uses active titles to emphasize the main points, supported by concise text annotations.  

### Choosing the Right Graph Type  
- **Line Charts for Trends:** Used to display historical and forecasted trends for room types, highlighting patterns over time.  
- **Bar Graphs for Comparisons:** Selected for boards comparing categorical attributes with quantitative values, such as borough-based price analysis.

## Dashboard Design Rationale  

### Simplicity and Consistency  
- **Minimalist Design:** A consistent use of grey tones ensures that key elements stand out without overwhelming the user.  
- **Clear Instructions:** Positioned in the top left corner to help users navigate the dashboard easily.  

### Interactivity  
- **Interactive Maps:** The average price map in the bottom left allows users to filter data in other graphs by selecting specific boroughs.  
- **Drop-Down Menus and Highlights:** Users can filter by room type or view average neighborhood prices through highlight actions.  
- **Organized Flow:** Interactivity starts broadly (borough-level) and narrows down to neighborhoods, ensuring a sequential, logical exploration.
